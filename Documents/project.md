# I Need Help

My Moonshot Project is called ***`I Need Help`***. <br>
It is an AI that will be able to detect when an old person needs help and will call the emergency services. <br>
The goal is to help old people to live longer and better in their own home.<br>
This "device" would be installed in people who want it. Elderly people usually have a routine, and if this routine is cut, then the device would detect it and send a signal that would allow action to be taken if necessary.<br>
This kind of device already exists but is not widespread enough for anyone to have access to it.<br>
I would like to make this device more accessible to the public and make it more affordable.<br>
